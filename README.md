Architecture components: MVVM with Data binding applicable in most cases.

A single-activity architecture, using the Navigation component to manage fragment operations.
A presentation layer that contains a fragment (View) and a ViewModel per screen (or feature).
Reactive UIs using LiveData observables and Data Binding.
A data layer with a repository and  remote data sources that are queried with one-shot operations.
Two product flavors, TESTING and PRODUCTION, to ease development and testing.
